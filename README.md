# Chocos' Crafting Tweaks

CCT is a minecraft datapack created to improve the vanilla building experience by correcting inconsistent recipes and adding new recipes for greater variety.

For the complete list of changes, read the [CCT Wiki](https://github.com/mygazthehealer/chocos-crafting-tweaks/blob/main/RECIPE.md). If you dislike a certain recipe but still want to use the datapack, you may delete the .json file corresponding to that recipe.

- Dirt/Grass Block and Water Bottle can be crafted to yield Mud (with Glass Bottle left)
- Sponge and Water Bottle can be crafted to yield Wet Sponge (with Glass Bottle left)
